# overheard
Mastodon bot in JavaScript.

You can find the bot account at [fosstodon.org/@overheard](https://fosstodon.org/@overheard). The bot is ment to be a feed like the [OverheardBsky](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:vjyot2w7zeomrslomwpfxirl/feed/aaajjrj657mnm) feed on Bluesky.

To use this bot, just mention it (`@overheard@fosstodon.org`) in a reply to a reply you find funny or silly out of context. There's still a few other bugs to figure out, like accounting for spamming its mentions ect. If you find any other bugs, or want to request a feature, then please open an issue on the Codeberg repo [https://codeberg.org/btp/overheard].
